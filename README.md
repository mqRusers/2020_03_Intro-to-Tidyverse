Intro to the Tidyverse modified from 2018 version. 
Note there are some sections of code that still have fun.y in them and these need to be changed to fun or fun.dat 
for compatability with updated packages. 
The same is true for the formatting of the stats summaries using ggplot - these can now be done with stat() mostly.
